I can never order jeans and they fit. I went to Old Navy just last weekend and tried on over 30 jeans - not a damn one fit. Pants are always hard for me. Apparently the stars aligned because these jeans are a gift from the heavens. Solid quality, stretchy waist, extremely comfortable and fits like a glove. They are a size small so I’m normally a 10 and ordered the 12 and it was perfect. Seriously, get them - you will not regret how good they are.;43 people found this helpful;https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07B6FD1H3%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_dp_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26csrfT%3DhK%252BJ57rWs1%252BUGjXNCK174Hu20IMAQ1GPkwg384fjBxRsAAAAAGjuGEkAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR3OWZ5B7EV849I%23R3OWZ5B7EV849I&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=en&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0;https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_dp_d_report&csrfT=hK%2BJ57rWs1%2BUGjXNCK174Hu20IMAQ1GPkwg384fjBxRsAAAAAGjuGEkAAAAB&reviewId=R3OWZ5B7EV849I;;;;

So it was either too long but fit or too short and kind of fit snug. I never ordered clothes online. I took a chance and I am now going to buy every pair in all the colors they have because I want to wear them every day. The material is comfortable and a nice thickness with a little stretch. The length is perfect and for the first time at my age, I feel like I am wearing pants that complement my adult curves. I am so grateful to have found this company. I am 5 foot 6 133 pounds. I hope this helps anyone looking. I got a size 8 long and they fit like a dream. Also, the color was true to what was shown, I purchased the renegade make.;13 people found this helpful;https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07B6FD1H3%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_dp_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26csrfT%3DhGCsxCEWh4k0e7SdsksJjHqURGO50V4wZuVz8BoFuPGsAAAAAGjuGEkAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR5APL492EAV2G%23R5APL492EAV2G&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=en&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0;https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_dp_d_report&csrfT=hGCsxCEWh4k0e7SdsksJjHqURGO50V4wZuVz8BoFuPGsAAAAAGjuGEkAAAAB&reviewId=R5APL492EAV2G;https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Y0ROAt9HL._SY88.jpg;https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/614JpcEOtJL._SY88.jpg;https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51p-sqWsP1L._SY88.jpg;

Here’s the size info to help you buy the correct size.
Me- 5’7” long legs! 170#
pictures are the size 16.

I always wear L (long) pants. I was already wearing Lee brand jeans which stretched. I started with a 12L, but gained weight and was wearing a 16L until I found these.

The previous Lee jeans had a waistband which came up to hip area.
But sadly I faced medical problems and consoled myself with ice cream. The medical problems were caused by the surgeon who left me with a deformed foot. It is very hard to get enough exercise when you can’t really walk well let alone run, jog, skip rope or do any other stuff that would help.

Ice cream + inactivity = fatness. Anyone who goes from a size 12 to a 16 has no business wearing jeans which don’t have enough fabric to make it up to the hip bones any longer. I’m sure I looked like some chubby middle aged woman who should look in the mirror and stop dressing inappropriately.

These jeans stretch pretty much all over. I ordered a pair in Amazon’s recommended of size 14 but also in the size I suspected was better for me, size 16.

I took reviewer’s advice and did not get “Long”.
This was sound advice, the long’s would have required hemming.

I tried the size 16 first- they are incredibly comfortable and soft. They are roomy in the right places and the waist band height is much better. The crotch area was an exception though. That shouldn’t feel like there’s extra unneeded fabric, but it did. After washing this hasn’t bothered me. I do need a belt to keep these up if my phone is in the pocket.

Next I tried the size 14. I’m fairly confident that they will fit better if I lost 5 pounds. Otherwise I can wear them but the fit feels too small and I suspect they might look too small. I actually ordered another size 16 so that I have more than one pair of blue jeans to wear.

Highly recommend these jeans no matter what body shape. If you are struggling with waistbands, which are too tight these jeans have more than enough stretch in the fabric. The waistband doesn’t roll or curl over after bending down and the length, even after washing has stayed exactly like it was when I got them I did not need to buy long. The regular length is quite long enough. Ever so grateful this brand has mastered making a denim material which stretches but still looks like a normal blue jean, It is soft and a joy to wear.";169 people found this helpful;https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07B6FD1H3%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_dp_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26csrfT%3DhASPZ00A%252BVU58yM37ELCzibzaBhg0QkC4pXIqA8egDCMAAAAAGjuGEkAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR7580WFKDZ9WM%23R7580WFKDZ9WM&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=en&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0;https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_dp_d_report&csrfT=hASPZ00A%2BVU58yM37ELCzibzaBhg0QkC4pXIqA8egDCMAAAAAGjuGEkAAAAB&reviewId=R7580WFKDZ9WM;https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif;https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif;https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif;

Played it safe and bought these Lee's jeans because I know I generally like the Lee fit. Color was as pictured. I bought a size 8 and it fit me well. 5'1, 170lbs. The leg is long even with boots but that's nothing new for a shawty like me lol. If you're taller, you just wont have an overhang, which isnt much tbh. The best part of these jeans is the waistband which I didnt realize is the Flex part of the description. It's an actual stretchable band. This mom bod appreciated that little surprise. I forgot which one I bought so im unsure if they all have this

Edit: I got the Majestic in size 10 short. Def not very short lol unless they sent the wrong one. I will check when im home but if its right, and you're worried about Short being too short, it will not. Its actually pretty long for 5'1";10 people found this helpful;https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07B6FD1H3%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_dp_d_vote_lft%3Fie%3DUTF8%26csrfT%3DhKtci7jZ8QVhOT0d44ChwtxPcpwiP0nh2L61obr6d%252FhCAAAAAGjuGEkAAAAB%26reviewId%3DRA6H96V75EKSQ%23RA6H96V75EKSQ&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=en&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0;https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_dp_d_report&csrfT=hKtci7jZ8QVhOT0d44ChwtxPcpwiP0nh2L61obr6d%2FhCAAAAAGjuGEkAAAAB&reviewId=RA6H96V75EKSQ;;;;https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif
